ðŸ¥‚ Hi, Iâ€™m Julieth, a **Data Analyst** focused on leveraging data to uncover business insights and drive efficiency because data is business. I developed proficiency through my hands-on experience in my role as Administrative /Virtual Assistant, taking the Excel for data analysis job simulations at JPMC, experience with the IT skills,Quantum Clouds and major dissertation at the University of Hertfordshire. Being able to leverage data requires research, and I am skilled at reviewing large documents and distilling important information, including collecting data from online sources, using databases like LSEG Refinitive, and performing comprehensive background research. My research and analysis expertise was honed during my master's program and I was able to use quantitative data analysis to uncover insights related to stakeholders and institutional impact of CSR on Financial performance.
I have worked on numerous data analysis projects in python, SQL and powerBI and I am using this medium to document my projects as I work on them. In my free time, I love exploring more data analysis techniques and projects. Feel free to reach out for collaboration and opportunities
